            <p>What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage 
                Utahceratops! Come to the Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, 
                Research Curator at the Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's 
                research has focused on the ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has 
                conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa.</p>
            <p>Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from 
                the University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids 
                (horned dinosaurs) from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the 
                growth and function of certopsid horns and frills.</p>
